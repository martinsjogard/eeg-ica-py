# msfun_meg_ica_viewer.py
# Placeholder: Due to the interactive MATLAB GUI design, a fully functional cross-platform viewer
# is difficult to replicate directly in a Python script. You'd use libraries like matplotlib, numpy,
# and possibly a GUI framework like PyQt5 or Jupyter widgets.

# Core logic would involve:
# - Displaying component time series or power spectra
# - Interactively browsing through components and time windows
# - Topographic plotting (e.g., using MNE-Python)

# This placeholder structure gives you the entry point and expected behavior.
# You will need to implement actual GUI/viewer behavior depending on your environment.
